# dotfiles
Set of dotfiles to configure my environments. This repo is part of my decision to go further with my terminal-based wrkflow as explained in this [article](https://erichammel.xyz/posts/going-terminal-based/) on my blog.

## Pre-req
`install.sh` will install the packages, cli tools, and create links for the different dotfiles

## Bash
Contains `.bashrc` and `.profile`

## tmux/
tmux config file

## vim/
contains `.vimrc` and a script installing plugins from GitHub.
